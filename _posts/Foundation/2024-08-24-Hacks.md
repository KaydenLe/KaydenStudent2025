Shell Commands:

Brew Commands:

Version Control: Cloning a repository means copying it to your computer so you can edit it. To save your changes, you need to commit and push them.

Localhost vs. Deployed Server:

Localhost: Only you can see it on your computer. The URL usually looks like http://127.0.0.1:4100/KaydenStudent2025/.
Deployed Server: Anyone can see it. URLs can be customized but often include your GitHub username and repository name.
DNS and GitHub Pages:

GitHub Pages gives you a URL like https://username.github.io/repository/. Each site has a unique URL based on your GitHub username and repository name.
The Domain Name System (DNS) helps manage web addresses. GitHub Pages provides a default URL, but if you use a custom domain (e.g., https://www.yourdomain.com), DNS makes sure visitors are directed to your GitHub Pages site.
Summary: For development, you use localhost to work on your project privately. When you’re ready for the public to see it, you deploy it to GitHub Pages. DNS helps with custom domain names, giving your site a professional web address.
