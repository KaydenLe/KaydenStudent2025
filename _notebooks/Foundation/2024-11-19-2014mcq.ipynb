    "I scored a 24/40 on the 2024 College Board Practice Exam MCQ. I was dissapointed at the score I got but I know that it was mostly just small mistakes. I know I need to review the college board and team teaches again. In the future I should take my time and think about each question thoroughly so I can prepare myself for the AP Exam."

    "My original answer is 2.333333 but I forgot about the x and y are both integers and it will round to 2 because of intger division. I spent 5 minutes on the question and I forgot to round. In the future I will analyze each integer.\n",

I spend a good amount of time on this question but I jsut don't think I read it thoroughly.\n",
