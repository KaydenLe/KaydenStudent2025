    "I scored a 24/39 on the 2015 College Board Practice Exam MCQ. I was disappointed at the score I got but I know that it was mostly just small mistakes. I know I need to review the college board and team teaches again. In the future I should take my time and think about each question thoroughly so I can prepare myself for the AP Exam.\n",
